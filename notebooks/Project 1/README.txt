No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
I am a data scientist and I am excited to gain some insight into the Seatl Airbnb dataset. As a traveler, sometimes I am struck by the anxiety of how to choose the best Airbnb for me. It depends on the situation, is this Airbnb just for a quiet night in or is it for a special occasion? Maybe I'm trying to make a good impression with the Airbnb I book, or maybe I'm in an uncomfortable travel situation with the family!

To help travelers like me find the best Airbnb for their needs and budget, the following questions were posed:

Where chractristics does a successful host have in Seatle Airbnbs?
Is price related to Airbnb quality in Seatle?
Are certain types of property that makes a host successful?
What are the best Airbnbs in each price range?

I desired the chance to delve into the data and convey my discoveries through a Medium blog post that is both captivating and informative, providing readers with valuable perspectives on the raised queries.

## File Descriptions
I have created an exploratory notebook that demonstrates my approach to the questions posed. Throughout the notebook, I have used Markdown cells to describe the steps I took.
