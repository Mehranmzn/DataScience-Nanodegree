## Project Motivation
In this project, my aim was to analyze user interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and provide personalized recommendations for new articles. The project was broken down into four main tasks: exploratory data analysis, rank-based recommendations, user-user based collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization.

## File Descriptions

`data`
Containes `.csv` files of raw data.     

`|- articles_community.csv # articles`     
`|- user-item-interactions.csv # user item interactions data`  

Also in the main directory,, step-by-step analysis provided in two files:
`Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb # Jupyter notebook `    
`Recommendations_with_IBM.html # html of jupyter notebook `    

To run the test function:
`debug.log`
`project_tests.py # project tests python script`

The readme file of the project:
`README.md `
